# 🚲 Google Data Analytics Capstone: Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was completed as part of the **Google Data Analytics Capstone**.  
The goal was to analyze how **annual members** and **casual riders** use Cyclistic bikes differently, and provide recommendations to help the company convert casual riders into annual members.

## 🔎 Analysis Process
- **Ask**: Define the business problem – how do annual members and casual riders differ?  
- **Prepare**: Collected 12 months of Cyclistic trip data (CSV files).  
- **Process**: Cleaned data (removed NULLs, duplicates, negative ride times). Created new variables (ride length, day of week, month).  
- **Analyze**: Compared trip durations, weekday vs weekend usage, and seasonal patterns.  
- **Share**: Built Tableau dashboards to visualize usage patterns.  
- **Act**: Suggested business strategies to increase memberships.  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Casual riders take **longer trips**, mostly on **weekends**.  
- Annual members take **shorter, consistent trips** mainly on **weekdays** (commuting behavior).  
- Casual ridership peaks in **summer months**, while members ride steadily year-round.  

## ✅ Recommendations
1. Offer **flexible pricing plans** to convert casuals into members.  
2. Target **tourists at popular stations** with discounts.  
3. Focus **marketing campaigns in summer** when casual ridership is highest.  

## 📈 Deliverables
